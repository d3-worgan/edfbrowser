Requirements
============
Qt  http://qt-project.org/

Minimum version 4.7.1 or later, preferable 4.8.6

Do not use Qt 5.x.x to compile EDFbrowser, Qt5 is not yet ready for production use. It contains still bugs that affects EDFbrowser.


The GCC compiler on Linux or Mingw-w64 on windows. <http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/>

http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/4.8.2/threads-posix/dwarf/i686-4.8.2-release-posix-dwarf-rt_v3-rev3.7z/download

Please, do not use any microsoft tools or compilers. Don't waste your time, it's not going to work!
