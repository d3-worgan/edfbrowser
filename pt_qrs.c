/* This is an implementation of the Pan-Tompkins QRS detector algorithm.
 * The performance has been tested on an annotated arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH):
 *
 * sensitivity: 99.79 %    positive predictivity: 99.45 %
 *
 * Se = TP / (TP + FN)   sensitivity
 *
 * +P = TP / (TP + FP)   positive predictivity
 *
 * TP: true positive detections
 * FN: false negatives
 * FP: false positives
 *
 * The following conditions apply:
 *
 * 1: maximum allowed misalignment (time skew) of the detected R-onset relative to
 *    the annotation in order to be a correctly detected beat, is 110 milli-Sec.
 *
 * 2: in case parts of the signal with ventricular flutter/fibrillation were excluded
 *    during the evaluation, the rates are:
 *    sensitivity: 99.79 %    positive predictivity: 99.79 %
 *
 * 3: For every record in the database, the lead with best signal quality was chosen.
 *    The first signal in the records was chosen, except for records 108, 113, 114, 116,
 *    117, 202, 222, 228, 232 for which the second signal was selected.
 *    In case always the first signal is selected for every record, the rates are:
 *    sensitivity: 99.65 %    positive predictivity: 99.30 %

 * But RR AVERAGE2 is updated only with RR intervals that are within the RR LOW LIMIT and RR HIGH LIMIT.
 * That means that, if suddenly the RR interval changes to a value outside of the limits and stays there,
 * the limits will never be adjusted. So, we use RR AVERAGE1 to derive the limits.
