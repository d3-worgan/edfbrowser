This is a fork of https://gitlab.com/Teuniz/EDFbrowser for the OpenSCORE/TEETACSI project. EDFBrowser has been modified 
to record the state of the UI to file. It also writes screenshots to file for later validation using a python
script.

1. Open EDFBrowser from the command line. The first argument is the absolute path to an EDF file. The second 
argument is an absolute path to the location where to save the log files.
2. EDFBrowser will create a directory in the specified output location. It will write a ui_log file, png screenshot
images to the screenshots directory, and montage files to the montages directory.
3. Close edf browser
4. Run the reprojection script in the scripts folder. A new folder should be created with the modified screenshots
displaying the visualisations for the tracked UI state.



Requirements
============
Qt  http://www.qt.io/

Qt4 minimum version 4.7.1 or later, preferable 4.8.7

or

Qt5 minimum version 5.9.1 or later, preferable 5.12.10

EDFbrowser is a GNU/Linux & GCC & GNU Make project. Other tools or compilers are not supported.


Introduction
============

EDFbrowser is a Qt application and uses qmake as part of the build process.
Qmake is part of your Qt installation.



Compiling and installing on Ubuntu Linux and derivatives
========================================================

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install g++ make git qtbase5-dev-tools qtbase5-dev qt5-default
git clone https://gitlab.com/Teuniz/EDFbrowser.git
cd EDFbrowser
qmake
make -j24  (change option -j according to number of available cpu cores/threads e.g -j4 or -j8)
sudo make install
edfbrowser




Advanced users (keep in mind, EDFbrowser is NOT a community project, pull/merge requests will be ignored)
=========================================================================================================

In case you want to compile EDFbrowser "static" with Qt5, here is a howto:

First, fulfill the requirements for Qt:

https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/linux.html

Debian/Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install build-essential libgl1-mesa-dev libcups2-dev libx11-dev

Fedora: sudo dnf groupinstall "C Development Tools and Libraries"
        sudo dnf install mesa-libGL-devel cups-devel libx11-dev

openSUSE: sudo zypper install -t pattern devel_basis
          sudo zypper install xorg-x11-devel cups-devel freetype-devel fontconfig-devel libxkbcommon-devel libxkbcommon-x11-devel

# Compile a static version of the Qt5 libraries excluding all modules that are not needed.  #
#                                                                                           #
# This will not mess with your system libraries. The new compiled libraries will be stored  #
#                                                                                           #
# in a new and separate directory: /usr/local/Qt-5.12.10-static                             #
#                                                                                           #
# It will not interfere with other Qt programs.                                             #
#                                                                                           #

mkdir Qt5-source

cd Qt5-source

wget https://ftp1.nluug.nl/languages/qt/official_releases/qt/5.12/5.12.10/single/qt-everywhere-src-5.12.10.tar.xz

here is a list of download mirrors: https://download.qt.io/static/mirrorlist/
The Qt source package you are going to need is: qt-everywhere-src-5.12.10.tar.xz

tar -xvf qt-everywhere-src-5.12.10.tar.xz

cd qt-everywhere-src-5.12.10

./configure -v -prefix /usr/local/Qt-5.12.10-static -release -opensource -confirm-license -c++std c++11 -static -accessibility -fontconfig -no-libudev -no-vulkan -skip qtdeclarative -skip qtconnectivity -skip qtmultimedia -qt-zlib -no-mtdev -no-journald -qt-libpng -qt-libjpeg -system-freetype -qt-harfbuzz -no-openssl -no-libproxy -no-glib -nomake examples -nomake tests -no-compile-examples -cups -no-evdev -no-dbus -no-egl -no-eglfs -qreal double -no-opengl -skip qtlocation -skip qtsensors -skip qtwayland -skip qtgamepad -skip qtserialbus -skip qt3d -skip qtpurchasing -skip qtquickcontrols -skip qtquickcontrols2 -skip qtspeech -skip qtwebengine

make -j24  (change option -j according to number of available cpu cores e.g -j4 or -j8)

(takes about 2.5 minutes on an AMD Ryzen 9 3900X)

sudo make install

Now go to the directory that contains the EDFbrowser sourcecode and enter the following commands:

/usr/local/Qt-5.12.10-static/bin/qmake

make -j24  (change option -j according to number of available cpu cores e.g -j4 or -j8)

sudo make install

Now you can run the program by typing: edfbrowser

Congratulations!
You have compiled a static version of EDFbrowser that can be deployed on other systems without the need
to install the Qt libraries.
In order to reduce the size of the executable, run the following commands:

strip -s edfbrowser

upx edfbrowser (if upx is not recognized as a command, install it using your package manager)



Requirements on macOS (warning, I don't have a Mac and I can not support it!)
=====================

Development tools from Apple: to get them, run

xcode-select --install

Qt >= 5.9.1: one method to get Qt on macOS is to install it via homebrew:

brew install qt

Note: after installing, qmake will likely not be in your $PATH, so you need to invoke it using its full path.


Build on macOS
==============

In the directory where you extracted sourcefile or cloned git repo, first run qmake, then make
(change option -j according to number of available cpu cores, get with 'sysctl -n hw.ncpu' command):

$(brew --prefix qt)/bin/qmake
make -j4

You can also build it in a dedicated subdirectory:

mkdir build
cd build
$(brew --prefix qt)/bin/qmake ..
make -j4

This will create the app bundle in the current directory, which you can then move to /Applications/ if desired.
